                    <p>This is one of many games just made with my and my mates for a laugh. 
                        Like 2048 but with physics, and some funny images. It's likely the 
                        most actually fun game I've made and it took me a day.</p>

                    <p>Another one made for an inside joke with my mates. Theres a lot fo these.
                        It's a parody of the FNaF series, mainly UCN, but with my friends as the 
                        animatronics, and each of their game mechanics corresponds to something
                        funny about them at the time.

                    <p>A pretty old game I made, intended to be breakout with some extra
                        steps. I realised that just playing with the balls was more fun 
                        than normal breakout so I just made that the whole game. It's 
                        weirdly addicting, especially with the sound design.

                    <p>I saw a video talking about how different people have 
                        different levels of ability to distinguish certian 
                        colours from others. Colourblind people being especially 
                        bad at it. So I made a quick game to test people on this. 
                        It's open source so somone actually forked it to have a 
                        bigger grid.

        <h2>YouTube</h2>
        <p>I've made far more videos than this, but these are the main one's I'd show off. My current channel 
            , idoblenderstuffs, has 3,000 subscribers. And my old one, ItsRainingNans, had about 1,800 subscribers.
            Most of my videos aren't public anymore. Around 230 have been made.

        <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
        <p>Although mostly showcased in my YouTube, there are some other 3D modelling things to note.
            Some models have been remade but not shown in a video yet, and some renders are unseen.
        </p>

        <h2>Texture art</h2>
        <p>Somehow, my most significant work in texture art is this pack of wall textures.
            I just made these because the only other existing ones on the SFM workshop were really bad.
        </p>
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2637309944&searchtext=fnaf+wall" class="modellink">Download from Steam Workshop</a>
        <br><br>
        <div class="modelrow">
            <img class="modelimg" src="textures/w1.png">
            <img class="modelimg" src="textures/w2.png">
            <img class="modelimg" src="textures/w3.png">
        </div>
        <div class="modelrow">
            <img class="modelimg" src="textures/w4.png">
            <img class="modelimg" src="textures/w5.png">
        </div>

        <p>These textures are seen in MANY animations from the past couple years, most notably:</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X6ELpluyZyg?si=VvuzIDQj_91uAfah&amp;start=108" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <p>They have even appeared in other people's games. For example, "FNaF: Co-op" on Roblox uses my wall textures a LOT. 
            Sadly though, they don't use my floor textures, which makes them look a little out of place.
        </p>

        <h2>Source Engine stuff</h2>
        <p>I've done my fair share of dabbling into Source Engine projects, a very old game engine made by Valve.</p>
        <p>For example, a map I've been working on for Half Life: Deathmatch:</p>
        <img class="singleimg" src="hl/dm1.png">
        <p>There are also my several Source FilmMaker ports, including the afformentioned wall models.
            I've made many, many more. But they are probably lost to time. Most were not posted to the 
            Steam Workshop, so they're lost on my old PC.
        </p>
        <img class="singleimg" src="hl/wall.png">
        <p>I even made some of my own tools for Source Engine porting! Mainly, my VMT and QC maker programs.</p>
        <div class="modelrow">
            <img class="modelimg" src="hl/vmt.png">

        <h2>Current project</h2>
        <p>My current project is a game called My Sweetest Dream.</p>
        <p>It is a survival horror point and click adventure game, aiming to have around 12 chapters on release.</p>

        <img class="singleimg" src="msd/cover.png">

        <p>Currently still working on Chapter 1. Everything seen so far is likely to be changed or redone.</p>
        <p>The game is being developed in Unity 3D, although I'm considering switching to being a Unity 2D game. For simplicity and aesthetic reasons.</p>

        <img class="singleimg" src="msd/jscare.gif">

        <p>Chapter 1 follows a girl named Charlotte. Her little brother seemingly runs away to an abandoned 
            park ride. She ventures into the building, unprepared for what has truly happened to her brother, 
            and what inevitably happens to her.
        </p>
        <p>Although seemingly insignificant on their own, every chapter plays a vital role in the overall plot.
            Chapter 1 would be around 20 minutes of gameplay, while every other chapter would aim for at least an hour.
        </p>

        <div class="modelrow">
            <img class="modelimg" src="msd/anthony.png">
            <img class="modelimg" src="msd/charlotte.png">
            <img class="modelimg" src="msd/sammy.png">
        </div>

        <img class="singleimg" src="msd/poster.png">

        <p>The game takes a lot of inspiration from old adventure games like Garage: Bad Dream Adventure, 
            and combines it with themes seen in modern Resident Evil games, while still remaining in the 
            Five Nights at Freddy's setting. Including a lot of existential horror elements, really striving 
            to innovate in the otherwise stale state of horror in the FNaF fangames field.
        </p>

        <img class="singleimg" src="msd/original.png">

        <p>This game will likely take multiple years to make. Alongside it having a couple revisions or 
            resets on the development. As afformentioned, Right now, I'm likely to scrap the current working 
            version of the game for a slightly simpler and prettier approach to things.
        </p>
